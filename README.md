# Asteroids
## Description
This is a javascript implementation of the classic game asteroid. Initial commit of the game was created using this excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWuU5ly0taA) by Derek Banas. I am planning to do additional work to expand upon the capabilities of the game.

## Improvements
  - Removed ability to fire after "GAME OVER" displays on the screen

## Planned Future Work
  - Update the respawn so that an asteroid in the center of the screen does not triple kill and cause game over.
  - Ensure that asteroids cannot spawn in the center of the screen and cause immediate game over
  - Ship destroyed animations
  - Selectors on the screen to change some of the game mechanics:
    - Number of asteroids
    - Difficulty (Speed of the asteroids)
    - Start button
    - Number of lives
